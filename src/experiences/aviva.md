During this role I have predominantly worked on an existing greenfield project, aimed at minimising duplication amongst various code bases within the business. The project used [Akka.NET][akka] for its backend and [SignalR][signal r] to update a [React][react] SPA. My existing knowledge of Akka.NET has been very valuable to the team.

Upon my arrival in the team, I quickly provided value by improving the stability of the unit tests for the solution which often required re-runs to pass.

Whilst working on the project I became a tech lead. I have been a lead developer on multiple projects. This involved raising stories, assisting with backlog prioritisation, gathering requirements, liaising with the business, assisting other developers in team, gate-keeping pull requests, managing dev ops pipelines, doing production deployments and running scrum ceremonies when the scrum master was unavailable.

During my time at Aviva I also wrote a simple service virtualisation tool that multiple teams used for over a year as an alternative to LISA/Dev Test before the business migrated to [WireMock][wiremock]. This was written in [TypeScript][typescript] and [Node.js][node].
