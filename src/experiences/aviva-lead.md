In January 2022 I was promoted to Lead Developer at Aviva. This involved moving to a new team. During this role I mostly provide support to developers in the team by performing activities such as gatekeeping pull requests and providing technical advice. I provide support to the business by performing activities such as high-level estimates, aiding backlog prioritisation and raising work-items.

The team works on a large number of ASP.NET MVC applications. They target .NET Framework but there is a large migration project being undertaken to migrate them to .NET 6.
