In 2022 I was formally promoted to Lead Developer at Aviva. I have been a lead in multiple teams during this role. I provide support to developers by performing activities such as gatekeeping pull requests and providing technical advice. I provide support to the business by performing activities such as high-level estimates, aiding backlog prioritisation and raising work-items. I work with architects to ensure their designs get implemented correctly. I assist in improving agile practices in the team. For example, I re-introduced planning poker back into the team. I attend regular meetings where we monitor the results of ongoing pen testing.

I have assisted with migrating code bases from .NET Framework to [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/). I have also assisted with containerising those applications with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). The company changed the entire dev ops pipeline for our containerised applications and I presentation to multiple teams explaining the new approach.
