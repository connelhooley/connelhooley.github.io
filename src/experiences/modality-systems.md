During this role I worked on various solutions built around Skype For Business. I helped the dev team build out release pipelines in VSTS and embrace TDD & testing automation. This involved a large mentality shift with regards to how QA was approached. We tried to involve our testers as early as possible with each user story. I particularly enjoyed embracing TDD.

I led the design of one project that involved the co-ordinating of over 50 machines. It used [Akka.NET][akka] and [SignalR][signal r] to achieve the distributed computing required. The machines could be configured using an [Angular2][angular2] [TypeScript][typeScript] web application. During this project we hired a junior dev whom I mentored which was an extremely rewarding experience.

I was also stand-in scrum master for this project. I was involved in various Microsoft TAP programs during my time in this role which was very interesting.

I found working with the other developers at Modality Systems extremely rewarding.
