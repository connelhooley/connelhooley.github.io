During this role I predominantly worked on a greenfield project, aimed at minimising duplication amongst various code bases within the business. The project used [Akka.NET](http://getakka.net) for its backend and [SignalR](https://www.asp.net/signalr) to update a [React][https://reactjs.org] SPA on the front-end. My existing knowledge of Akka.NET was very valuable to the team.

Upon my arrival in the team, I quickly provided value by improving the stability of the unit tests for the solution which often required re-runs to pass.

One year into the role I became a tech lead, which gave me lead developer gate keeping responsibilites. I also worked the role of lead developer on multiple projects. This involved raising stories, assisting with backlog prioritisation, gathering requirements, liaising with the business, assisting other developers in team, gate-keeping pull requests, managing dev ops pipelines, doing production deployments and running scrum ceremonies when the scrum master was unavailable.

During my time at Aviva in this role I also wrote a simple service virtualisation tool that multiple teams used for over a year as an alternative to LISA/Dev Test before the business migrated to [WireMock](http://wiremock.org). This was written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
