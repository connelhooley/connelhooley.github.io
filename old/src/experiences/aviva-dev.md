During this role I predominantly worked on a greenfield project. The project used [Akka.NET](http://getakka.net), [SignalR](https://www.asp.net/signalr) and [React](https://reactjs.org). My existing knowledge of Akka.NET was very valuable to the team. I quickly provided value by improving the reliablility of the solution's unit tests.

One year into the role I became a tech lead, which gave me lead developer gatekeeping responsibilities. I also worked the role of lead developer on multiple projects. This involved raising stories, assisting with backlog prioritisation, gathering requirements, liaising with the business, assisting other developers in the team, gate-keeping pull requests, managing dev ops pipelines, doing production deployments and running scrum ceremonies when the scrum master was unavailable.
